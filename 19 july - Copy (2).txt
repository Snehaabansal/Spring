root component or bootstrap component from where it starts or it is the
first component contained by app component.
module is a  group of components
main.ts search for module
index.html runs the component that page will be load in the browser ,only one component at a time it run tht's why spa
main.ts entry point like main function in program
main.ts which module to run
app module contains bootstrap module
in our project we will not make user module we use app module
in big application we have many modules
atleast one module one component minimum is required for the application
by default we can use root module or we can make user modules
client application can call any api's so angular is not much related to server.

we can directly write app home in place of app root to run it in index html and bootstrap = home componenet  in place of app componentbut this is not a gud idea
for template we do not use single code we use back tick ` (present above with tilde sign)
styles and stylesUrls use array for it since it is plural
bootstrap take only one component at a time

ng g c sample -it -is --skip-tests
to create component with inline style and inline template (second method to do so)

------------Data binding---------------------------------------------------
using double {{}} one way binding  changes in component(ts file) will be visible in view(html )but not viceversa.
in interpolation (one way binding) data is converted as string

ng serve for running server in diff cmd
in another cmd:-after going inside firstApp folder using cd firstApp
ng g c home
ng g c login
ng g c login --skipTests to skip test file which we dont need
ctrl+c terminate the job press yes to compile again to refresh  the page and ng serve again
